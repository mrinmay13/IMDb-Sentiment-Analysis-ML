# IMDb Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of IMDb movie reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms.

üîç Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IMDb reviews
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, punctuation cleaning
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
- Model development with Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visualizations: Word clouds, bar charts, review length distributions, and more

üß∞ Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project provides insights into how textual data can be transformed and used for supervised classification. Great for anyone exploring NLP applications in movie review analysis.
